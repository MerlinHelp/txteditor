GOAL: Command-line text editor

TODO:
    Shortterm:
        1. For all functions that write to the screen, utilize the abuf struct
        and ab_append function newly built to have only 1 write in function. 
        2. Map Delete/Backspace to delete chars
        4. TODO ITEM IN editor_io.c:14 (Change printKeysMode to have MACROS or
        to combine with currEditingMode)
            * I think if we end up combining currEditingMode + printKeysMode,
            * we can make macros for like VIEW (no print) + VIEW_PRINT
            * then for view processor, we can if currEditingMode is VIEW_PRINT
            * print else not, so its all in one var.
        5. Limit scrolling out of screen/line
    Longterm:
        1. Get a separate text viewer/editor when running program
        2. Be able to save, make new files, and interact with files (unistd??)
