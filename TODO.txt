GOAL: Command-line text editor

TODO:
    Shortterm:
        1. Brainstorm what features I should start with
        2. Map certain input to ASCII escape characters

    Longterm:
        1. Get a separate text viewer/editor when running program
        2. Be able to save, make new files, and interact with files (unistd??)
