GOAL: Command-line text editor

TODO:
    Shortterm:
        1. For all functions that write to the screen, utilize the abuf struct
        and ab_append function newly built to have only 1 write in function. 
        2. Add backspace, arrow keys, figure out text viewer/editor soon
        3. TODO ITEM IN editor_io.c:108 (Fix not being able to go backwards/bind
        arrow keys)
            * I think We can not go backwards because nothing is written on
            * screen so it assumes that it has reached the end
        4. TODO ITEM IN editor_io.c:14 (Change printKeysMode to have MACROS or
        to combine with currEditingMode)
            * I think if we end up combining currEditingMode + printKeysMode,
            * we can make macros for like VIEW (no print) + VIEW_PRINT
            * then for view processor, we can if currEditingMode is VIEW_PRINT
            * print else not, so its all in one var.
    Longterm:
        1. Get a separate text viewer/editor when running program
        2. Be able to save, make new files, and interact with files (unistd??)
