GOAL: Command-line text editor

TODO:
    Shortterm:
        1. Add backspace, arrow keys, figure out text viewer/editor soon
        2. TODO ITEM IN editor_io.c:108 (Fix not being able to go backwards/bind
        arrow keys)
            * I think We can not go backwards because nothing is written on
            * screen so it assumes that it has reached the end
        3. TODO ITEM IN terminal.c:111 (Finish get_cursor_position function)
    Longterm:
        1. Get a separate text viewer/editor when running program
        2. Be able to save, make new files, and interact with files (unistd??)
